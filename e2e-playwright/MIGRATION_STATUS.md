## Tests That Cannot Be Migrated (2)

### Sync Tests (1)

- sync/webdav-basic (missing setupWebdavSync implementation)

### Performance Tests (1)

- perf.e2e.ts (uses custom enablePerformanceMetrics() and getPerformanceMetrics() methods)

## Skipped/Commented Tests (6)

1. **planner/planner-basic.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

   - Reason: Unknown, entire file is commented

2. **planner/planner-drag-drop.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

3. **planner/planner-multiple-days.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

4. **planner/planner-navigation.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

5. **planner/planner-scheduled-tasks.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

6. **planner/planner-time-estimates.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

## Failed Migration Attempts

- **task-list-basic/simple-subtask** - Attempted but removed due to keyboard shortcut issues with 'a' key triggering in textarea instead of creating subtask

## Tests with Skipped Scenarios

1. **plugin-iframe.spec.ts** - 3 tests skipped due to iframe content timing issues:

   - verify iframe loads with correct content
   - test stats loading in iframe
   - test refresh stats button

2. **project.spec.ts** - 1 test skipped:

   - create second project (UI element not found)

3. **work-view-features.spec.ts** - 1 test skipped:

   - should show undone and done task lists (done button click issues)

4. **project-note.spec.ts** - 2 tests skipped:
   - create a note (create project button not visible)
   - new note should be still available after reload (same issue)

## Migration Summary

### Total E2E Test Coverage:

- **Nightwatch Tests**: 38 total (excluding empty TODO files)

  - 28 successfully migrated (73.7%)
  - 2 cannot be migrated (5.3%)
  - 6 commented out (15.8%)
  - 2 remaining unmigrated (5.3%)

- **Playwright Tests**: 30 test files
  - 47 total test cases
  - 5 test files with skipped scenarios
  - 10 individual test cases skipped

### Key Issues:

1. **Create Project Button**: Not visible in UI, affecting project-related tests
2. **Iframe Content Access**: Cross-origin issues with plugin iframe tests
3. **Performance Metrics**: Custom Nightwatch methods not available in Playwright
4. **WebDAV Sync**: Missing implementation for sync setup

## Notes

- When migrating, preserve exact selectors from Nightwatch tests
- Avoid adding timeouts unless absolutely necessary
- Keep test structure as close to original as possible
- Each test should be committed separately after verification
- Tour dialog interference has been addressed by setting localStorage key
- Some tests have flaky behavior due to timing issues with dynamic content
