## Tests Still Needing Migration (1)

### Sync Tests (1)

- sync/webdav-basic (missing setupWebdavSync implementation)

## Skipped/Commented Tests (9)

1. **perf.e2e.ts** - Active but uses custom performance methods

   - Uses enablePerformanceMetrics() and getPerformanceMetrics()

2. **planner/planner-basic.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

   - Reason: Unknown, entire file is commented

3. **planner/planner-drag-drop.e2e.ts** - Fully commented out

   - Reason: Unknown, entire file is commented

9. **sync/webdav-basic.e2e.ts** - Cannot migrate
   - Missing setupWebdavSync implementation

## Failed Migration Attempts

- **task-list-basic/simple-subtask** - Attempted but removed due to keyboard shortcut issues with 'a' key triggering in textarea instead of creating subtask

## Tests with Skipped Scenarios

1. **plugin-iframe.spec.ts** - 3 tests skipped due to iframe content timing issues:

   - verify iframe loads with correct content
   - test stats loading in iframe
   - test refresh stats button

2. **project.spec.ts** - 1 test skipped:

   - create second project (UI element not found)

3. **work-view-features.spec.ts** - 1 test skipped:
   - should show undone and done task lists (done button click issues)

## Notes

- When migrating, preserve exact selectors from Nightwatch tests
- Avoid adding timeouts unless absolutely necessary
- Keep test structure as close to original as possible
- Each test should be committed separately after verification
- Tour dialog interference has been addressed by setting localStorage key
- Some tests have flaky behavior due to timing issues with dynamic content
